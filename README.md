### Hello! My name is Nitipong Kadsritalee.

Yep, that's me.

I'm currently 20 years old. 

I'm from Rayong, Banchang.\
It is quite far away, so I don't get many chances to go home.

I'm currently taking CN331, a course in Computer 
Engineering Degree of Thammasat University.

I hope I will be able to do well in this course!

Well, I guess we can talk about my favorite foods?

1. Fried Chicken : Clear Winner right here. 
1. Noodle Soup : It's hot and tasty! 
1. Fried Rice : Very simple meal.
1. Stir-Fried Basil with Meat : Also very simple, but simple is the best.

Yes, I know that's ***a lot of carbs***, but... well, might as well enjoy it before I get old.\
~~And I'm currently trying to reduce some of it as well.~~

### I guess that's about it!
